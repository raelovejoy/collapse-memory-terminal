# ☠️ Collapse Memory Terminal

_A poetic, terminal-style ritual for remembering after collapse._

This project simulates a post-collapse memory interface:  
a meditative CLI-like space to journal, scan for echoes, and reconnect with yourself and others—through slow tech, ritual, and reflection.

Try it. Remember forward.

> “Collapse is not the end. It is the soil.”
