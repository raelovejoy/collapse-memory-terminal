# ☠️ Collapse Memory Terminal

_A poetic, terminal-style ritual for remembering after collapse._

This project simulates a post-collapse memory interface:  
a meditative CLI-like space to journal, scan for echoes, and reconnect with yourself and others—through slow tech, ritual, and reflection.

Try it. Remember forward.

## 📂 Philosophy
This isn’t a productivity tool.  
It’s a space to **reclaim slowness**, **ritual**, and **reflection** amid systemic collapse.  
Inspired by solarpunk, glitch aesthetics, and mutual aid.

> You are not alone. Static remembers.
